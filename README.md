# TicTacToe-Android-dApp

This project is an implementation of an online Tic-Tac-Toe game. Users can create accounts. Upon creating an account, they will be given an id, which will be required to log in later on. After logging in, the user's game statistics (number of games played and number of games won) will be shown. They can then create a game or join some already created game. When creating a game, they will be asked for the number which represents the length of the Tic-Tac-Toe board and they can set a password or keep it empty. If it is empty other players will know that this game is "free", so they can join if they want. Otherwise, the user needs to give the password to their friend, so they can join in. Upon creating a game, the user will be given a game ID, which will also be required for the friend to join in the game. After the second player joins, the game will start and at this point if anyone leaves, he/she will lose. The creator has the first turn. During the game, each player takes turn alternatively. After the game ends, the players' game statistics will be changed accordingly.

Currently, the Back-end is complete and it supports all the activities mentioned above i.e. creating account, logging in, creating or joining a game, playing it with a friend or stranger, saving the statistics in the end. It can be tested using `truffle'. However, the front-end only supports account creation, login, and creating a 3 by 3 game. Currently, the game processing part does not work. Besides that, it can also be further developed by designing more n by n boards.

To run this project, the necessary soft-wares are android studio and Ganache. First, deploy the project using an account from ganache. There are several ways of doing it. You can use truffle or android studio to do it. The front-end is not complete yet. It can be used to create account, log in, create a game, and join a game. For gameplay, you may look at my other truffle project, which can be run in truffle console. That can be found here:
